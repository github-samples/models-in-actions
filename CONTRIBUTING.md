## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
1. Add your workflows to the `workflows` directory. Each action should be in its own subdirectory, and the name of the subdirectory should match the name of the action.
1. Make sure your workflow file has setup instruction at the top of it in comments.
1. Make sure to add a `README.md` file in the action's subdirectory. This file should describe what the action does, how to use it, and any inputs or outputs it has.
1. Make sure to add your action to the `README.md` file in the root of the repository. This file should list all the actions in the repository and provide a brief description of each one.
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]
1. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Show what the output of the workflow looks like. If you can, include a screenshot or a link to a run of the workflow in your pull request description.
- Only submit one workflow per pull request. This makes it easier for us to review and merge your changes.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
